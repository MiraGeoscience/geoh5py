geoh5py: Python API for geoh5, an open file format for geoscientific data
=========================================================================
The **geoh5py** library has been created for the manipulation and storage of a wide range of
geoscientific data (points, curve, surface, 2D and 3D grids) in
``*.geoh5`` file format. Users will be able to directly leverage the powerful visualization
capabilities of `Geoscience ANALYST <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Online documentation <https://mirageoscience-geoh5py.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_

See also documentation for the `geoh5 file format`_.

.. _geoh5 file format: docs/content/geoh5_file_format.textile


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**geoh5py** is currently written for Python 3.10 or higher, and depends on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and
`h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_. Users will likely want to also make use of advanced processing
techniques made available under the python ecosystem. We therefore recommend installing a **Conda** distribution
such as `miniforge`_ to handle the various packages.

.. _miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Install **geoh5py** from PyPI::

    $ pip install geoh5py


Setup for development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
