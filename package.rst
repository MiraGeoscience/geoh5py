geoh5py: Python API for geoh5. An open file format for geoscientific data
==========================================================================

The **geoh5py** library has been created for the manipulation and storage of a wide range of
geoscientific data (points, curve, surface, 2D and 3D grids) in
`geoh5 file format <https://gist.github.com/jincandescent/06a3bd4e0e54360ad191>`_.
Users will be able to directly leverage the powerful visualization
capabilities of `Geoscience ANALYST <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_ along with open-source code from the Python ecosystem.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**geoh5py** depends on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_.

.. note:: Users will likely want to take advantage of other packages available in the Python ecosystem.
    We therefore recommend using `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download>`_ `(Windows x86_64) <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_


Install **geoh5py** from PyPI::

    $ pip install geoh5py
