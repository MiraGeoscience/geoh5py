geoh5py: Python API for Geoscience Analyst
==========================================
The **geoh5py** library has been created for the manipulation and storage of a wide range of
geoscientific data (points, curve, surface, 2D and 3D grids) in
``*.geoh5`` file format. Users will be able to directly leverage the powerful visualization
capabilities of `Geoscience Analyst <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**geoh5py** is currently written for Python 3.6 or higher, and depends on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and
`h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_. Users will likely want to also make use of advanced processing
techniques made available under the python ecosystem. We therefore recommend installing
Anaconda to handle the various packages.

Install **geoh5py** from PyPI::

    $ pip install geoh5py
