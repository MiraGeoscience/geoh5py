About
=====


Welcome to the documentation page for **geoh5py**.

This library has been created for the manipulation and storage of a wide range of
geoscientific data (points, curve, surface, 2D and 3D grids) in
`geoh5 file format <https://gist.github.com/jincandescent/06a3bd4e0e54360ad191>`_.
Users are able to directly leverage the powerful visualization
capabilities of `Geoscience ANALYST <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/>`_ along with open-source code from the Python ecosystem.
